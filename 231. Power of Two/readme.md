
# General Repo Format is as follows

## Whiteboard

- Contains solution work, approach, and all other notes




## properties.json

Contains the following

| Property      | Description |
|------------|---------------------|
| title      | Name of the problem |
| difficulty |Difficulty of the problem |         
| assistLvl  | roughly how many external resources were used                     | 
|                     | 0 being no external resources | 10 being a copy paste from a solution                     | 
|                     | further information may be found under whiteboard Solution.txtw              | 
|    attemps        |number of attempts, will probably restructure this in the future and place each attempt as an iteration of a problem                     | 
|    approxTime        | approximate time it took to complete the problem "DD:HH:MM" Reading DD- Days, HH- Hours, MM- Minutes                    | 
|    approxTimePlusMinus        | plus or minus to see how roughly estimated the approxTime value is, also "DD:HH:MM" Reading DD- Days, HH- Hours, MM- Minutes                    |


## Solution.py
